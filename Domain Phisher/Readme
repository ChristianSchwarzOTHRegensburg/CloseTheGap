# Domain Phisher

A simple Tool to see if someone has registered a Domain similiar to your own, which could be used for phishing.

-V1 (Basic Version): only ten Lines of Code, splits Domain into Domain Name and TLD
-V2: creates Versions of the Input Domain (e.g. [domain]-customerservice) and adds various TLDs
-V3: checks Similiarity of Input TLD, simple Infoscreen for the User to choose transformations
-V4: does a Whois Lookup to see if the generated Domains are registered which could be a sign that someone is using them for phishing
