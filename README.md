# CloseTheGapCybersecurity

turning theoretical programming knowledge into practical projects. In Close the Gap - Cybersecurity these projects will mainly be about security.

Planned topics are among others:
- WordPress Bruteforce (Bruteforce the WordPress Login Page)
- Email Harvester (find all email addresses on a specific site or collect as many as you want from the internet)
- Domain Phisher (check if someone is using a domain similar to yours for phishing) 
- Virus Scanner (build a simple Virus Scanner by comparing file hashes with real malware hashes)
- Social Password (build your own rainbow Tables and wordlists from social media profiles)
- Further projects can be added, the final e-book should contain about 10 copies

Suggestions for further projects are welcome, these should be realizable in about 100-200 lines of code. Each project starts with a basic version that contains the absolute minimum functionality to show the feasibility of the solution. In 3 -4 further steps the basic solution is then improved and additional functionality is added.

The E-Book will be available for free, who wants to participate in the project can contact me
