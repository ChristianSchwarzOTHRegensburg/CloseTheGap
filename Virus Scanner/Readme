# Virus Scanner

A simple Virus Scanner to understand how these things work. We start by checking if we can find a file based on its hash value. Later we will check for hashes of real Malware inside a directory we specify. Last Part will be a simple GUI to make the Scanner more accessible

-V1 (Basic Version): generate a hashvalue for two given files
-V2: uses the generated Hash from V1 to check if the Test File is inside the specified directory
-V3: use real Malware Hashes and read them from file, generate GUI Alert if Hash matches (In Progress)
-V4: add simple GUI to our Virus Scanner where User can choose directory and see some statistics (scanned files, found problems) (In Progress)

Used Libraries
- hashlib (https://pypi.org/project/hashlib/)
- os (Python Standard Library)
